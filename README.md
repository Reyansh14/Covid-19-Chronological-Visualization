# Covid-19-Chronological-Visualization
This is a Covid-19 Chronological Visualization made in Python using the Pandas and Plotly libraries.

The data is sourced from John Hopkins University using their CSSE COVID-19 dataset on Github. I used Pandas to load their "time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv" file to dataframe and to format it. Then, I used Plotly Express in order to map the data and create a visualization by the date in order to track the progression of the virus.

To Do: Let the program automatically update the dataset every day and add more visualizations for the total recovered cases and total deaths by country.
